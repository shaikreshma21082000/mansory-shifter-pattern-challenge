## Layout Shifter Pattern Challenge

## Context

Responsive Design patterns are used to make a web page responsive across various devices of varying screen sizes.Most design patterns will use breakpoints to adapt for different screen sizes. A Breakpoint is the point at which a different CSS will be applied, usually through a media query, to optimize the design for the user’s viewport. A good example of a breakpoint would be one where your layout has to change from two columns to four columns from one device to another.

The layout shifter pattern is the most responsive pattern, with multiple breakpoints across several screen widths.

The Key difference to this layout is the way content moves about, instead of reflowing and dropping below other columns. Due to the significant differences between each major breakpoint, it is more complex to maintain and likely involves changes within elements, not just overall content layout.

This pattern does the most to adapt across different screen sizes and hence inherently requires more work. That is, different layouts are used on large, medium, and small screens.

## Challenge

Create a Web Page which changes the layout at every break point on multiple screen sizes using Layout Shifter Pattern matching the following images.
